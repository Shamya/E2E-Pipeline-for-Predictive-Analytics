# E2E-Pipeline-for-Predictive-Analytics

This worksheet illustrates an end to end pipeline used for solving general machine learning tasks. It includes various techniques in the following key stages: 
- Data preparation
- Understanding the data
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Testing model generalizability
- Post pipeline reflection

For illustration purpose, I have chosen "classification" as the task and have attached a sample data (data.csv) to run the code. But the intention is to introduce you to these stages and provide you with starter code to extend it to your problem statement.
