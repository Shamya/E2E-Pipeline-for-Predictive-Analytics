# E2E-Pipeline-for-Predictive-Analytics

This worksheet illustrates an end to end pipeline used for solving general machine learning tasks. It includes (but is not restricted to) various techniques in the following key stages: 
- Data preparation
- Understanding the data
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Testing model generalizability
- Post pipeline reflection

For illustration purpose, I have chosen "classification" as the task and have attached a sample data (data.csv) to run the code. But the intention is to introduce you to these stages and provide you with starter code to extend it to your problem statement. Feel free to contact me at shamya16[at]gmail[dot]com for feedback, comments and clarification.
